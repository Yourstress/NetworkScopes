Features:
- [Done] Warn when class is not serializable (check ProtoContract and ISerializable).
- [Done] Allow serialization of any type by adding [ProtoContract] on your class, and [ProtoMember] on the members you want to serialize.
- [Done] Allow serialization by implementing the ISerializable interface (in the NetworkScopes namespace).

Issues:
- Use ISerializable to make Maybe<T1,T2> function properly.

Removed Features:
- Authentication.
- NetworkObject and children.
- NetworkList<T> works the same as List<T>, and notifies remote machines on the same scope about any modifications to the list (add, remove, clear).
- [ClientScope] Signal queueing
